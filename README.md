Please see the following link for the deployed app:
App is no longer deployed. Please run it locally on your machine. If you want me to update, place a PR, when there is sufficient demand I will update the deployment. 

Updated per November 2024: no longer deployed because of Python version no longer available on Streamlit-share.

To re-create, please clone the added yml file in your conda system. 
Then, with the flair_nerD environment active, go to your terminal and type:
streamlit run /path/where/you/saved/NER_POS_TAG.py
