Please see the following link for the deployed app:
https://share.streamlit.io/sgoede/ner_pos_tag/main/NER_POS_TAG.py

Updated per April 2022 to accommodate Streamlit >=0. 8. Now the app shows spans and has a explanatory table for the abbreviations used by the tagger.

To re-create, please clone the added yml file in your conda system. 
Then, with the flair_nerD environment active, go to your terminal and type:
streamlit run /path/where/you/saved/NER_POS_TAG.py

-Enjoy :)
